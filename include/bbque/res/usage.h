/**
 * @brief The usages of a resource
 *
 * An application working modes defines a set of this resource requests
 * (usages).
 *
 * A resource usage descriptor embeds a couple of information:
 * The first is obviously the value of the usage, the amount of resource
 * requested. The second is a list containing all the descriptors (shared
 * pointer) of the resources which to this usage refers. We expect that such
 * list is filled by a method of ResourceAccounter, after that the
 * Scheduler/Optimizer has solved the resource binding.
 *
 * The "resource binding" can be explained as follows: if a Working Mode
 * includes resource requests like "tile.cluster2.pe = 4", the
 * scheduler/optimizer must define a binding between that "cluster2" and the
 * "real" cluster on the platform, to which bind the usage of 4 processing
 * elements. Thus, after that, the list "bindings", will contain the
 * descriptors of the resources "pe (processing elements)" in the cluster
 * assigned by the scheduler/optimizer module.
