 *      @brief  The Run-Time Library (RTLib) to access the Barbeque RTRM
 *      framework
 *
 * The Barbeque RTRM is a modular and efficient resource allocator for
 * many-core clustered accelerator engines, which provide support for:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>mixed workload management</li>
 *  <li>dynamic resource partitioning</li>
 *  <li>resources abstraction</li>
 *  <li>multi-objectve optimization policy</li>
 *  <li>low-overheads run-time management</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Modern many-core computing platform are targeted to the execution of a
 * <i>mixed-workload</i> where multiple applications, with different
 * requirements and criticality levels, run concurrently thus competing on
 * accessing a reduce set of shared resource. Provided that each of these
 * application is associated with a proper description, which should specify
 * the mapping between an expected Quality-of-Service (QoS) level and the
 * correposnding resources demand, the Barbeque RTRM allows to arrange for an
 * "optimal" resources allocation to all the active applications.
 *
 * The main goal of the <i>dynamic resource partitioning</i> support is to
 * grant resources to critical workloads while dynamically yield these
 * resources to best-effort workloads when (and only while) they are not
 * required by critical ones, thus optimize resource usage and fairness.
 *
 * In order to improve applications portability among different acceleration
 * platforms, the Barbeque RTRM provides support for <i>resource
 * abstraction</i> which allows to exploit a decoupled perspective of the
 * resources between the users and the underlying hardware.  The user
 * applications will see virtual resources, e.g., the number of processing
 * elements available, but they will not be aware of which of the physical
 * resources are effectively available. At run-time the RTRM will perform
 * the virtual-to-physical mapping according to the current <i>multi-objective
 * optimization function</i> (low power, high performance, etc..) and run-time
 * phenomena (process variation, temporal and spatial temperature gradients,
 * hardware failures and, above all, workload variation).
 *
 * Finally, introducing a low overhead on managing resource at run-time, while
 * still granting a valuable solution for the aformentioned issues is one more
 * goal of the Barbeque RTRM framework. This goals also as required the
 * development if this RTLib run-time library which applications should
 * exploit in order to take advantages from the Barbeque RTRM.
 *
 * This document provides the definition of the interface and related services
 * exported by the Barbeque Run-Time library (RTLib). This library is provided
 * to be linked by application that needs to interact with the Barbeque (BBQ)
 * Run-Time Resource Manager (RTRM). The library not only defines the set of
 * services accessable by applications, but allows also to mask the platform
 * specific communication channel between controlled applications and the
 * run-time manager. Moreover, the library provides some of the functional
 * supports required for a proper integration of an application with the RTRM,
 * thus offloading the application developer as much as possible from the
 * Run-Time management required boilerplate integration code. Indeed, form an
 * application developer perspective this library enforeces just the
 * conformance to a properly define "Application Lifecycle", by specifying a
 * set of calls and the order on which these should be performed.

 * state, i.e. a changing of working mode has the lower impact on both

 * could be: the end of a frame deconding for a video decoding application,
