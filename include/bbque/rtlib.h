 * @brief Synchronization point notification and AWM authorization.
 * @ingroup rtlib_sec03_plain_rtm
 *
 * An execution context (EXC) is enchouraged to support the Barbeque RTRM by
 * notifying the reaching of a synchronization point. A synchronization point
 * is a point during the workload processing, when the EXC is on a consistent
 * state, i.e. a changing of working mode has the lower impact on both
 * performances and workload trashing. Some example of synchronization point
 * could be: the end of a frame deconding for a video decoding application,
 * the end of a packet processing for networking applications.  The execution
 * context is required to notify these events to the RTLib which in turns
 * could exploit them to better arrange working modes reconfiguration among
 * all the active applicatons.
 *
 * Moreover, in a Run-Time Resource Managed system the Barbeque RTRM has the
 * role to assigne an Operating Point to each active application. Thus, each
 * application is required to call this method every time a Working Mode
 * change could be expected, i.e. at each synchronization point or when a
 * working mode should be initially assigned after the EXC has been enabled.
 *
 * Thus, at each synchronization point the application is required to call
 * this method and decide what to do based on the returned code.  If a working
 * mode change is required by the Barbeque RTRM, this method returns an error
 * which could be used to identify the kind of reconfiguration required.
 * Please not that, in each of this last cases, the application is expected to
 * perform the required re-configuration and then to call this method again to
 * get the authorization on using it. Indeed, this second call is used the the
