/**
 * @class  StaticPlugin
 * @brief A static plugin wrapper class
 *
 * This class provides a simple mechanism that lets static plugins register
 * their objects automatically with the PluginManager without requiring the
 * application to explicitly initialize them. The way it works (when it
 * works) is that the plugin defines a global instance of the StaticPlugin
 * and passes it its initialization function (with a signature that matches
 * PF_InitFunc). The StaticPlugin simply calls the
 * PluginManager::InitializePlugin() method that ignites the static plugin
 * initialization just like with dynamic plugins after loading the dynamic
 * library.
