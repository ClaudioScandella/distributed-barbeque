  prompt "RPC Channel"

  config BBQUE_RPC_FIFO
    bool "FIFO based"
    ---help---
    Use the FIFO based RPC channel

endchoice

config BBQUE_TEST_PLATFORM_DATA
  bool "Use Test Platform Data (TPD)"
  default n
  ---help---
  Build the BarbequeRTRM with support for Test Platform Data.
  When compiled with this option turned on, all the target specific
  platform control facilities are disabled.

  This could be a convenient way to use the BarbequeRTRM for initial
  application development and integration, without worry about daemon
  setup or requiring to run the daemon as root.

comment "RTLib Configuration"

config BBQUE_RTLIB_PERF_SUPPORT
  bool "Enable Performance Counters support on RTLib"
  depends on TARGET_LINUX
  default y
  ---help---
  Build the Run-Time Library (RTLib) with support for Performance Counters.
  these counters allows an application, which has been integrated with the
  RTLib, to collect transparently a set of profiling information related
  to the run-time execution.

  This option is useful to port easily the RTLib on platforms not supporting
  performance counters, such as some Android devices with older kernels.


menu "Advanced options"

config BBQUE_BUILD_DEBUG
  bool "Build a DEBUG version"
  default n
  ---help---
  Build the BarbequeRTRM with DEBUGGING support enabled.

  This will produce a version of both the daemon and the RTLib with much more
  logging messages and debug symbols, which is suitable for debugging purposes.

comment "Scheduling Policies Configuration"

config BBQUE_SP_YAMS_PARALLEL
  bool "YaMS parallelized execution"
  default y
  ---help---
  Build the YaMS policy with support for parallelized metrics computation.

  Select this option if you plan to run the BarbequeRTRM daemon on a multi-core
  host machine.
