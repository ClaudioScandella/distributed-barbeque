/**
 * @brief A TEST for the Application-BBQ interaction
 *
 * This test class simulate core interactions between applications and
 * Barbeque RTRM.
 * It simulates the registering of a set of resources, and the start of an
 * application. Here a recipe is loaded and all the check upon correctness of
 * resource usages defined in are made.
 * Once the ApplicationManager confirms the application has loaded, the test
 * print out their working modes details and then trigger some scheduling
 * status and working mode changes (passing overheads info too).
 *
 * By using the term "core" we are excluding the part regarding the
 * communication interface with the RTLib. Indeed the focus of the test is to
 * verify the correctness of the changes of scheduling status of applications.
 * Such changes are triggered by prop√®r method calls.
 *
 * As a consequence of scheduling changes, a variation in resource usages
 * accounting should be observed.
 *
 * Platform initialization is simulated too through a function that, given an
 * hard-coded set of resources, invokes the resource registration method of
 * ResourceAccounter for each of them.
