                .:: Barbeque Run-Time Resource Manager ::.

The BarbequeRTRM is a framework being developed at DEI - Politecnico di Milano
- under the context of the European Project 2PARMA and it has been partially
funded by the EC under the FP7-ICT-248716-2PARMA grant. This framework is the
core of an highly modular and extensible run-time resource manager which
provide support for an easy integration and management of multiple applications
competing on the usage of one (or more) shared MIMD many-core computation
devices. The framework design, which exposes different plugin interfaces,
provides support for pluggable policies for both resource scheduling and the
management of applications coordination and reconfiguration.
